# Pengaduan Masyarakat Web App

 I'm going to be honest here :) , so I actually just doing an experiment to demonstrate that I can make a web app using AI entirely. So this web app was made using Github Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4 and GPT). I was actually shocked by how this web app turned out. It's shockingly scary, that if I had recreated it 4 years ago, it might have taken 1 week. 

 In this Web App all the code was just Github Copilot and I just made the prompts to work with my plan. So what's my job in this web app? I was just fixing the bugs that the AI made and making minor changes.
